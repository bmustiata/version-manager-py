# vm 2.0.14

Updates versions across multiple files.

## Install

```sh
pip install vm
```


## Usage

You need a `versions.json`, or a `versions.yml` where you can specify for what
you're tracking the versions, and what files to be updated using glob patterns:

```yaml
germanium:
  version: 1.10.3
  files:
    README.*: "^(germanium )(.*?)$"
    setup.py: "version='**VERSION**',"
    doc/usage/index.adoc: "^(= Germanium v)(.*?)$"
    germanium/version.py: "current = \"**VERSION**\""
```

Help:

```text
usage: vm [-h] [--display NAME] [--all] [--set NAME=VAL [NAME=VAL ...]]
          [--load FILE] [-t]

Versions processor

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --display NAME, -d NAME
                        Display the version of a single tracked version.
  --all, -a, --list     Display all the tracked versions and their values.
  --set NAME=VAL [NAME=VAL ...], -s NAME=VAL [NAME=VAL ...]
                        Set values overriding what's in the yml files.
  --load FILE, -l FILE  Override versions from the given yml file.
  -t, --tag-name, --tag
                        Get the current name to use in general tags.
```

## Specifying Versions

The version value will be expanded using the shell if it contains a '$' or a
'`', so you can have a version such as:

```json
"description": {
  "version": "Build at $(date) on $(uname -n)"
}
```

Versions can also refer to other version files, and extract properties from
there, using the `parent:` notation in the version:

```json
"germaniumdrivers": {
  "version": "parent:../germanium/@germaniumdrivers"
}
```

The path will point to the `versions.json/yml` file, or to the folder that
contains the `versions.json/yml` file, and after that fill will be read and
interpreted the `germaniumdrivers` version will be used.

Versions can be also manually overriden from the command line, using the
`--set` or `-s` flag, for example:

```sh
vm -s germanium=2.0.8
```

This will ignore the value specified in the versions.yml file, and use the
specified one.

## File Matchers

There are currently only four file matchers:

### RegExp File Matcher

It is a RegExp that has two or three groups, and it will have the 
second group replaced to the matched version.

### **VERSION** File Matcher

This will construct a RegExp that will match exactly the given text, with
the `**VERSION**` being the second group.

So having a matcher such as:

```json
"files": {
    "README": "This installs version **VERSION** of the product."
}
```

is equivalent with:

```yaml
files:
    README: "(This installs version )(.+?)( of the product\\.)"
```

If the `**`s are replaced with `^^` at the beginning, or `$$` at the end, they
will act as RegExp anchors, equivalent to `^` and `$`. In case in the
expression there is content before the `^^`, or after the `$$`, the content is
ignored.

### maven: File Matcher

This will construct a RegExp that will match:

```text
`(<groupId>${m[1]}</groupId>\\s*` +
`<artifactId>${m[2]}</artifactId>\\s*` +
`<version>)(.*?)(</version>)`;
```

In order to specify the matcher, just use:

```yaml
germanium:
  version: 2.0.0
  files:
    pom.xml: maven:com.germaniumhq:germanium
```

## Matcher Constraints

In order to make sure that the expressions are not replacing
in too many places, constraints can be added to limit, or extend
the matches.

Matcher constraints are always active, and in case no constraint
is specified then the maximum replacement count is set to 1. 

### Match Count

```json
"product" : {
  "version": "1.0",
  "files": {
    "README.md": {
      "match": "^(= Germanium v)(.*?)$",
      "count": 1
    }
  }
}
```

The count can be also `0` for no matches, or negative to indicate
any number of matches is allowed.

## Multiple Matchers

In a single file, we can have multiple matchers as well, for
example:

```json
"product" : {
  "version": "1.0",
  "files": {
    "README.md": [
      "^(= Germanium v)(.*?)$",
      "(Germanium )(\\d+\\.\\d+)()"
    ]
  }
}
```

For each matcher that is added, if there is no match count specified, it's
assumed that it will only match once in the file.

Of course, constraints can be applied for both the full set of
matchers:

```json
"product" : {
  "version": "1.0",
  "files": {
    "README.md": {
      "match": [
        "^(= Germanium v)(.*?)$",
        "(Germanium )(\\d+\\.\\d+)()"
      ],
      "count": 3
    }
  }
}
```

or even individual expressions: 
 
```json
"product" : {
  "version": "1.0",
  "files": {
    "README.md": {
      "match": [
        "^(= Germanium v)(.*?)$",
        {
          "match": "(Germanium )(\\d+\\.\\d+)()",
          "count": 2
        }
      ],
      "count": 3
    }
  }
}
```

## Notes

1. Files are actually `glob` patterns, so you can match `**/*.js` for example.
2. The configuration files can be yml.
3. `vm` will output the following error codes: 0 when no files are
   changed, 0 when files are changed successfuly, or a non zero error code in
   case of error.
